Three Card War

* Play begins with the player making a mandatory Ante wager between $5 and $500.
* Two rows of three face-down cards will be dealt, and the player will select one of the two rows to wager on; the dealer will be given the other hand.
* Each card is then revealed.  If the player's three cards all beat the three dealer's cards, the player wins; otherwise, the player loses.
** Note that the player will win a tie between their card and the dealer's opposing card.
** Note that aces count as high for the player, and count as low for the dealer.

If the player wins, their ante will be paid according to the following paytable, based on the total margin of victory of all three cards:
0-18:	4-for-1
19-26:	5-for-1
27-30:	10-for-1
31-34:	25-for-1
35-36:	50-for-1
37:		100-for-1
38:		500-for-1
39:		1,000-for-1
